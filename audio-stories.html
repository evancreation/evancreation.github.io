                        An audio documentary exploring how clothing shapes identity and self-expression. Through intimate 
                        interviews, participants reflect on their favorite articles of clothing and what they reveal about 
                        personal history, confidence, and belonging.

                    <p>
                        The piece weaves together diverse perspectives—from platform Demonia boots that make someone feel tall 
                        and confident, to cargo pants that signal adulthood and professionalism, to college night shirts that 
                        carry memories of dorm life and friendship. Each story reveals how we use clothing to navigate identity, 
                        comfort, and self-presentation.

                        <strong>Production:</strong> Conducted interviews, edited and mixed audio using Adobe Audition. 
                        Crafted narrative structure to highlight themes of gender expression, memory, and the everyday ways 
                        clothing tells our stories.

                    <h3>Transcript</h3>
                    <p><strong>Speaker 1:</strong> Ooh, what's my favorite article of clothing? I'd have to say my demonias, my big platform demonia boots, because they can make like any outfit cuter really fast and they make me feel very tall.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Speaker 2:</strong> This shirt I am wearing right now because it is probably the first shirt I got after getting here in college for the first time on my own.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Speaker 3:</strong> Cargo pants, because they make me feel official and professional and like an actual like adult and stuff.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Speaker 4:</strong> I like earrings because I can be creative with them and like I like putting silly things on my ears.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Speaker 5:</strong> Sweaters, because they're warm and comfortable.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Speaker 6:</strong> I really like shoes because if I had to walk barefoot, it'd be a really big sensory issue.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Speaker 7:</strong> Dresses, because they made me feel confident.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Speaker 8:</strong> My converse, I wear them literally everywhere. They are my best friends. Yes, they have holes. I don't care.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Speaker 9:</strong> Probably a night shirt I had when I was in college. Now, why would be because it brings back good memories of dorm life and the friends that I had when I was in college.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Speaker 10:</strong> I decided it's not a specific article of clothing. It's any article of clothing that you can buy oversized.</p>
