                    A mini-documentary profiling Paul Ford, evening operations supervisor at Appalachian State University's 
                    Plemons Student Union. The film explores the often-invisible labor that makes campus life possible and 
                    highlights the dedication of staff who shape student experiences behind the scenes.
                </p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    Through intimate interviews, the documentary reveals how Ford has spent 21 years creating the "living room 
                    of campus" while mentoring student workers and fostering their professional growth. The piece emphasizes 
                    themes of labor visibility, mentorship, and the value of service work in higher education.

                <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem; color: var(--neon-violet); font-family: 'Teko', sans-serif; font-size: 1.5rem;">Transcript</h4>
                <div style="margin-top: 1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--text-dim);">
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><em>Narrator:</em> The Plemons Student Union serves as the heart of campus life. Behind the scenes, dedicated staff ensure this vital space runs smoothly. Today we meet Paul Ford, manager of evening operations.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Paul Ford:</strong> Hi, I'm Paul Ford. I've been here for 21 years. I'm the evening operations supervisor and it will be 21 years in this upcoming July.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">One of the terms we use is that the Student Union is the living room of the campus. Sometimes with the solarium we think of it as the front porch of the university. And so we take a lot of time making it as comfortable as possible in so many ways. From our furniture to what's on the floors, the paint on the walls, all of it goes into thoughts of being welcoming and being the living room of campus.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">We're very much a student-run paradigm and to the point where my student supervisors really do run the place day to day.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The start of growth for most of our students is responsibility. And that can be as simple as, here, take the keys and go open this door. Even though it's a small task, once you've taken—you know, for a lot of people, once they have a little bit of responsibility, they want more. And that's, you know, we're there to help fund the folks who really want more responsibility.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Oh, students. The students I work with. And then seeing them getting fabulous jobs or establishing—or, you know, achieving all kinds of great goals. We honed the work ethic a lot of times and taught the value of doing things. I keep in touch with a lot of students and seeing their success is important.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">For the last 20 years, I can't imagine what I would have done that would have been any better for me.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><em>Narrator:</em> The next time you visit the Plemmons Student Union, remember the dedicated staff working behind the scenes to create a welcoming space for all. Thank you.</p>
